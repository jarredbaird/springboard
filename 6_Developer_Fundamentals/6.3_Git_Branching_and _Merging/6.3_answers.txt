git branch <new_branch> OR git checkout -b <new_branch>

fast forward is the basic merge --> happens when there have been no commits since the last branch
recursive is when there are multiple commits going on on different branches at the same time and then they try to merge and everything explodes

git checkout <branch>

git branch -d <branch>

two peeps make their own branches, make changes to the same files, and then merge into the same branch again.
